- Collections are commonplace in programming and, thanks to lambda
expressions, using them is now much easier and simpler in Java.
- We can trade the long-winded old methods for elegant, concise code
to perform the common operations on collections.
- Internal iterators make it convenient to traverse collections,
transform collections without enduring mutability, and select elements
from collections without much effort.
- Using these functions means less code to write.
- That can lead to more maintainable code, more code that does useful
domain - or application-related logic, and less code to handle the basics of coding.
