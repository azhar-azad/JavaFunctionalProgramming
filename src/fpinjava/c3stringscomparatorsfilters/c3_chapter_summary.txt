- The regular tasks of working with strings and files and creating custom comparators
got a lot easier and more concise with lambda expressions and method references.

mutability dispappeared like the fog in the modern sun.
- As a bonus for favouring this style, we can benefit from the new JDK facilities
to iterate efficiently over large directories.
