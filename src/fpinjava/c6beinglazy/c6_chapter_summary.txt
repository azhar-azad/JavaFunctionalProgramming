- Efficiency got a boost in Java 8; we can be lazy and postpone execution of code
until we need it.
- We can delay initialization of heavyweight resources and easily implement the
virtual proxy pattern.
- Likewise, we can delay evaluation of method arguments to make the calls more efficient.
- The real heroes of the improved JDK are the Stream interface and the related classes.
- We can exploit their lazy behaviours to create infinite collections with just a few
lines of code.
- That means highly expressive, concise code to perform complex operations that we
couldn't even imagine in Java before.
