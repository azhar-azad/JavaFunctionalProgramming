- We can't totally rely on automatic garbage collection, especially when our applications
use external resources.
- The 'execute around method' pattern can help us gain finer control over the flow of
execution, and release external resources.
- Lambda expressions are a good fit to implement this pattern. In addition to controlling
the object lifetime, we can use this pattern to better manage locks and to write concise
exception tests.
- This can lead to more deterministic execution of code, timely cleanup of heavyweight
resources, and fewer errors.
